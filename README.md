Implementing Unit Test Using JUnit - JAVA Programming

Downloaded and unzip the file "CS612UnitTestlab" then imported the file to Eclipes.
This is a basic java JUnit testing  tool where I have used basic test class and JUnit test suite, which uses to test the code if the output genrated is accurate and as expected
I have created two Junit testing tool java program one is for Divide and the second is square, I have also implemented AllTest.java where all test are tested together.
